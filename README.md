# HelloVaporPlot
Server-Side Swift with Vapor: Hello World with Plot

To build this check out my blog entry at http://squishyphotons.blogspot.com/2022/03/server-side-swift-blog-entry-1-hello.html

in summary:
make a new vapor project, add the plot dependency, add the HTML protocol extension to conform to ResponseEncodable, and then add an endpoint with some Plot code in it
